<msg type="warning" file="ConstraintSystem" num="0" >The Offset constraint &lt;OFFSET = IN 20 ns BEFORE COMP &quot;clk_33&quot;;&gt; [leon3mp.pcf(43044)], is specified without a duration.  This will result in a lack of hold time checks in timing reports.  If hold time checks are desired a duration value should be specified following the &apos;VALID&apos; keyword.

<msg type="warning" file="ConstraintSystem" num="0" >The Offset constraint &lt;OFFSET = IN 5 ns BEFORE COMP &quot;erx_clk&quot;;&gt; [leon3mp.pcf(43046)], is specified without a duration.  This will result in a lack of hold time checks in timing reports.  If hold time checks are desired a duration value should be specified following the &apos;VALID&apos; keyword.
